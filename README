Alien-InteractiveBrokers

This module automates the installation of the InteractiveBrokers API files
and source code, and provides accessor functions to describe its location,
include paths, etc.

It was developed in conjunction with Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG
and POE::Component::Client::InteractiveBrokers, as a way of simplifying
distribution and installation of these needed files.

BUILD NOTES

If you get notices like the following (only noticed under Cygwin):

    Build: blib/script/ibapi-config: cannot resolve L<POE> in paragraph 53.
    Build: blib/lib/Alien/InteractiveBrokers.pm: cannot resolve L<Alien> in paragraph 48.
    Build: blib/lib/Alien/InteractiveBrokers.pm: cannot resolve L<POE> in paragraph 94.

Ignore them.  They are only warnings about cross-referencing documentation
on the local machine, and they do not affect the actual build.
